# The High Tower (alpha testing 1.0)
Hello, if you are reading this, congratulations.  You just opened what may the start be a long, hard, and epic journey of my life as a gamedev.
I do not expect this to be an immediate success, hell, I expect to get at least the basic parts of my game down in a few years.
If I do complete this game and you ever do come back, here is a short checklist of things I hope to accomplish with this game

# Basic Checklist
1. Get actual sprites for characters (you and your allies are goblins, the enemies are knights.  You are basically the villian of the game lol! ;P)
2. Fix up and make actual game controls
3. Add levels and make the game take place in an actual tower
4. Add a title screen
5. Have a final level where you must battle a fat king
6. Add a second map where instead of having levels, you have to fight against time
7. Add different skins
8. Make a multiplayer mode
9. Sell the game (DUH)

And with that being said theres also a checklist for what I want to do with "dobermangames.codehs.me"

# DMG CHECKLIST
1. Make it an actual arcade website for (mainly) HTML games. (And later include other games using other languages as well).
2. Put +100 Games on the website (most of them arent gonna be mine, don't worry about an overload of bad/WIP games.)
3. Probably become the leading HTML game site (just big dreaming out here lol!)
